# Facebook Wall Personality Insights

This website gets posts from your Facebook wall using the Facebook Javascript SDK for the Graph API and then runs them through the IBM Personality Insights API in Node.js.

This website is based on a demo for the Personality Insights API. As such, it has its relevant licenses mentioned here: https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/personality-insights-nodejs?cm_mc_uid=75503884160114438582704&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1452641715
At the above link you will find "Getting Started" and "Running locally" instructions that can be followed for this website as well if you wish to run this website yourself.

The website was made on a Macbook Pro Mid 2009 running OS X El Capitan with the Atom IDE.
