# Facebook Wall Personality Insights

This website gets posts from your Facebook wall using the Facebook Javascript SDK for the Graph API and then runs them through the IBM Personality Insights API in Node.js, a demo for which this website is largely based on.

All relevant licenses for the demo as well as instructions (should be able to follow more or less the same) on how to get this website running are here: https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/personality-insights-nodejs?cm_mc_uid=75503884160114438582704&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1452641715

Live demo here (hopefully still running whenever someone sees it): https://fb-feed-personality-insights.mybluemix.net/
